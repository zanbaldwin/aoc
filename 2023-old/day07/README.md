# AoC 2023 (Day 07)

## Progress Report
- Part 1
  - This was solved fairly easily, though not quickly
  - I could have solved it quicker but decided to spent a lot of time practicing
    extending traits from the standard library.
- Part 2
  - Oh, this was hard
  - I'm pretty sure I approached this incorrectly to start with in part 1
  - Yes I could have solved this quicker by copying the logic from part 1 and
    modifying it by I want to keep everything in lib, damnit!
  - I ended up basically copying and pasting structures instead of logic to end
    up with something stupidly complex
  - I really should have just done today as a quick and dirty solve instead of
    wasting time and effort
- Other
  - I'm not going to let surgical complications ruin my winning streak because
    I'm stubborn
  - I'm on some pretty strong painkillers right now, waiting for emergency
    surgery tomorrow morning, and my brain is mostly fog right now
