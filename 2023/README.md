# Advent of Code 2023

A few solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023),
written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and organised into a
[Cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html).

The solutions to each day's problems are attempted initially, and then compared
to [Chris Biscardi](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/)'s
[solutions](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code/tree/main/2023/rust).
When a solution cannot be found independently, Chris' solution is used as a
reference for a learning opportunity.
