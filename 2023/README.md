# Advent of Code 2023

A few solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023),
written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and organised into a
[Cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html).

The solutions to each day's problems are attempted initially. When a solution
cannot be found independently, I first look for inspiration (and memes) and then
possible answers at [/r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).
