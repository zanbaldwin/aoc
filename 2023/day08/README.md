# AoC 2023 (Day 03)

## Progress Report
- Part 1
  - Nice
  - Easy to solve
  - Got play with some nice parsing
  - Took my mind off upcoming jaw surgery
- Part 2
  - Got the unit tests working
  - But I'm in a lot of pain
  - Oh. My. God. The aftermath of this surgery hurts so much more than the one
    last month.
  - Fuck this, I can't concentrate on getting the right answer
  - For some reason, WiFi has just stopped working on this laptop so I can't
    even push my commits
  - I'm done
- Part 2 (again)
  - After a long nap, and a fuck ton of painkillers, I'm able to think again
  - Was browsing Reddit and saw mentions of LCM in most posts about Day 8
  - So I'm along the right lines at least
  - Turn computer back on and replaced the binary GCD algorithm I copied from
    Wikipedia with the standard recursion method I was taught in school
  - Euler's method, I think it's called? I don't know off the top of my head
  - Brain is still too mushy for me to care - it works and I got the star
  - No more for today
