# AoC 2023 (Day 03)

## Progress Report
- Part 1
  - Nice
  - Easy to solve
  - Got play with some nice parsing
  - Took my mind off upcoming jaw surgery
- Part 2
  - Got the unit tests working
  - But I'm in a lot of pain
  - Oh. My. God. This aftermath of this surgery hurts so much more than the one
    last month.
  - Fuck this, I can't concentrate on getting the right answer
  - For some reason, WiFi has just stopped working on this laptop so I can't
    even push my commits
  - I'm done
