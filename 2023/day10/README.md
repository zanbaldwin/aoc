# AoC 2023 (Day 10)

## Progress Report
- PSetup
  - It's here!
  - The kind of problem that I couldn't solve in previous years!
  - Graph traversal (I think)
  - I'll be really proud of myself if I can solve this without looking up
    somebody else's solution
  - I know that whatever I come up with will be inefficient and lacking any
    decent algorithms
  - But I'll try my best!
