# AoC 2023 (Day 10)

## Progress Report
- Setup
  - It's here!
  - The kind of problem that I couldn't solve in previous years!
  - Graph traversal (I think)
  - I'll be really proud of myself if I can solve this without looking up
    somebody else's solution
  - I know that whatever I come up with will be inefficient and lacking any
    decent algorithms
  - But I'll try my best!
- Part 1
  - `thread 'part1::tests::test_part1_input2' has overflowed its stack`
  - Kind of excited, I've never had a stack overflow error before!
  - Been programming for over a decade, used Stack
  - Finally completed, that took so much longer and so many more unit tests than
    I thought it would
- Part 2
  - Oh. My. God.
  - You want me to do what?
