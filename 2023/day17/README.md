# AoC 2023 (Day 17)

## Progress Report
- Setup
    - Ah.
    - I was wrong on Day10.
    - **This** is graph traversal.
    - I've never actually implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm before.
    - I might as well throw in potentials into those weights and do A* while I'm at it.
    - I'm not sure how long this will take me.
    - I am really weak when it comes to implementing mathematical algorithms.
- Part 1
    - I was right
    - It's really hard to hold all this in my mental map
    - Too many hours have gone by
    - I need to stop
    - I'm not giving up
    - I'll come back to this another day
    - Because I **really** want to successfully implement the A* algorithm
    - It's like a bucket list item for me
    - But honestly? I just want to go to bed at a reasonable hour
    - And get some reading in before then
