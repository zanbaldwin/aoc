# AoC 2023 (Day 03)

## Progress Report
- Part 1
  - Parsing was fun
  - Keeping modules in lib.rs today just to see how it feels
  - Unit tests pass
  - Input could not be parsed
  - Numbers in input are too big
  - Update i32 to i64
  - Input correctly parsed and answer generated was correct
- Part 2
  - Easy enough to implement, just one extra method on Almanac struct
  - Pretty sure this can be optimised, as it took nearly 10 minutes to calculate the answer
  - But that's a problem for another day perhaps
